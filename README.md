# Mario Party Basic
Mario Party Basic is a simplified version of the iconic video game franchise that's playable in your browser.

## How It Works
---
To play this game, you'll start by going to this link: [Mario Party Basic](https://rsato1007.github.io/). Next it will provide instructions on how the game works. Essentially you and a computer player will roll a dice. This entails you clicking the dice on the webpage. It will roll a random number between 1-6. It will move you on the board based on what you rolled. When you land on a space, a few things can happen:
- Landing on a blue space nets you 3 points.
- Landing on a red space loses you 3 points.
- Landing on a green space can either: give/take 10 points or swap places with the computer.

Whoever gets 20 points first wins the game.

## Planned Features
---
Since the initial inspiration was Mario Party, there are a few ideas planned:
- Big Game Features:
    - Four player option.
    - ability to allow two human players to play.
    - A star space on the board that randomizes it's location everytime and you buy a star by paying 20 coins (points would be converted to coins). The game winning state would change to getting two stars first.
    - Minigames, plus code that chooses a minigame randomly after all players have rolled the dice.
- Minor Features:
    - Arrows appearing that give the user the ability to select which direction they go.
    - Allowing the user to input a nickname
    - Allowing the user to choose a color.

## Known Bugs
---
The game features a couple bugs that I am currently working on fixing:
- Clicking "cancel" on the branch route moves you down.

## About The Author
---
My name is Robert and I created Mario Party Basic as part of a project for General Assembly's coding bootcamp. I wanted to do something that involved a little more complexity to really push my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS understanding.
